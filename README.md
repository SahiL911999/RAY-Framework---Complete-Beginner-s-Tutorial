## 🎯 Quick Start Example

Here's a taste of what you'll learn:

```python
import ray

# Initialize RAY
ray.init()

# Define a regular function
def slow_task(n):
    result = 0
    for i in range(n):
        result += i ** 2
    return result

# Make it distributed with just one decorator!
@ray.remote
def fast_task(n):
    result = 0
    for i in range(n):
        result += i ** 2
    return result

# Run tasks in parallel
futures = [fast_task.remote(10_000_000) for _ in range(4)]
results = ray.get(futures)

# Expected speedup: 2-4x on a quad-core machine! 🚀
```
